
Senior Project User Guide:

Download the entire /exe/ folder and launch the prefered executable. The
64x64 excutable generates a smaller, more efficient, terrain compared to 
the 256x256 executable which generates a larger terrain that can better 
exemplify the effects of raycasting. After launching the executable the 
chunks, octree, and meshes will generate.

You will then be able to move around the environment using WASD, the space 
bar, and your mouse. Clicking and dragging with the mouse will pivot the 
camera. Holding both mouse buttons down will also allow you to move in the 
direction of the camera (useful for moving down/quicker).


There are 4 rendering modes that you can cycle through by pressing 'B'. 
(Starts at 1).

	1: Marching Cubes Mesh Rendering
	2: Naive Rendering 
	3: Naive (Recursive) Octree Rendering
	4: Raycast Rendering

NOTE: Meshes will not render if you are looking at them from behind.
NOTE: Naive rendering is very slow.

Mode 4 will only display voxels after a raycast has been computed. 
A fullscreen raycast can be computed by pressing 'Q' and individual rays
can be cast with 'Z'. 

It is recommended that you position the camera while in rendering mode 1 before
initializing the full-screen raycast. WARNING: This will take an extended 
period of time (It can take up to a minute to compute on my computer).

After computing a full-screen raycast you can fly around the environment
to see its effects. Pressing 'Z' will cast a single ray, render
the trace, and print the traversal of the ray through the octree.
		
Voxels can be destroyed or created by getting sufficiently close and 
pressing 'R' or 'T' respectively. (Does not apply to Octree rendering)

Pressing 'V' will toggle polygon mode.
Pressing 'F' will output the current FPS.
Pressing 'G' will output your current position.
