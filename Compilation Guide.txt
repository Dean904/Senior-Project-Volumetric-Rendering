To compile the project open a new visual studio 2017 project 
and add all of the /src files.

The first step toward compilation is linking the libraries to the project.
Go to the solution explorer and then 'VC++ Directories'

We can then add directories to let the project know where to search.
Add a new entry of the direct path to '\libraries\Include' in the
'Include Directories', you should also add a path to your project folder
so the include<etc.h> statements work. Also take this opportunity to add
the Libs folder to the 'Library DIrectories'.

Next go to the 'Linker' tab, then 'Input' and add the following list to the 
additional dependencies:
	opengl32.lib
	glfw3.lib
	glew32s.lib
	assimp-vc140-mt.lib
	libnoise.lib
	
Finally, make sure to place the following files in the /libraries folder into
your project folder.
	libnoise.dll
	assimp-vc140-mt.dll
	
	
If the project does not compile, you may have to compile the libraries so they
are customized for your computer using CMake. A good tutorial can be found here:
