## Senior Project: Volumetric Rendering of 3D Data

In this project I researched, analyzed and implemented various volume rendering techniques. Ultimately, I implemented the [Marching Cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) meshing algorithm and [raycasting into a sparse voxel octree](https://users.aalto.fi/~laines9/publications/laine2010tr1_paper.pdf).

### Final Report

The final report for my project can be found in the root of the this repository, [here.](https://github.com/Dean904/Senior-Project-Volumetric-Rendering/blob/master/Final%20Report.pdf)

    _Abstract_
```markdown
    This report provides a cursory introduction to volumetric rendering and discusses a methodology
    from both paradigms of volume rendering, Indirect and Direct Volume Rendering, in depth. The 
    report discusses the selected reference implementations of the Marching Cubes Meshing algorithm, 
    an indirect volume rendering technique, and Sparse Voxel Octree Raycasting, a direct volume 
    rendering technique, as well as the developed implementations within the projects environment 
    and the projects results.
