
Senior Project User Guide:

After launching the executable the chunks, octree, and meshes will generate.

You will then be able to move around the environment using WASD, the space 
bar, and your mouse. Clicking and dragging with the mouse will pivot the 
camera. Holding both mouse buttons down will also allow you to move in the 
direction of the camera (useful for moving down).

NOTE: Meshes will not display if you are looking at them from behind.

There are 4 rendering modes that you can cycle through by pressing 'B'. 
(Starts at 1).

	1: Marching Cubes Mesh Rendering
	2: Naive Rendering
	3: Naive (Recursive) Octree Rendering
	4: Raycast Rendering
	
Mode 4 will only display voxels after a full-screen raycast has been
computed. This can be done by pressing 'Q'. It is recommended that you 
position the camera while in rendering mode 1 before initializing the
full-screen raycast. WARNING: This will take an extended period of time
(It can take up to a minute to compute on my computer).

After computing a full-screen raycast you can fly around the environment
to see its effects. You may also press 'Z' to cast single rays and view
the trace and output of the raycast algorithm.
	
	
Voxels can be destroyed or created by getting sufficiently close and 
pressing 'R' or 'T' respectively. (Does not apply to Octree rendering)

Pressing 'V' will toggle polygon mode.
Pressing 'F' will output the current FPS.
Pressing 'G' will output your current position.
